And it\\'s sort of an extremely easy to  learn tool to use for implementing a lot of \\nlearning algorithms.  \\nAnd in case some of you want to work on your  own home computer or something if you \\ndon\\'t have a MATLAB license, for the purposes of  this class, there\\'s also — [inaudible] \\nwrite that down [inaudible] MATLAB — there\\' s also a software package called Octave \\nthat you can download for free off the Internet. And it has somewhat fewer features than MATLAB, but it\\'s free, and for the purposes of  this class, it will work for just about \\neverything.  \\nSo actually I, well, so yeah, just a side comment for those of you that haven\\'t seen \\nMATLAB before I guess, once a colleague of mine at a different university, not at \\nStanford, actually teaches another machine l earning course. He\\'s taught it for many years. \\nSo one day, he was in his office, and an old student of his from, lik e, ten years ago came \\ninto his office and he said, \"Oh, professo r, professor, thank you so much for your', metadata={'page': 8, 'source': '/content/MachineLearning-Lecture01 (1).pdf'})"
